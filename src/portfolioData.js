  aboutme:
    "I am a recent graduate from Coder Academy (CA) Bootcamp. During my time with CA, I completed 3 projects using different tech stacks (Ruby on Rails, Postgres SQL, JavaScript, MERN stack, Bootstrap and Git collaboration). At my internship with Skychute, I gained valuable commercial production experience and  successfully implemented full stack components with my newly acquired skills in TypeScript, Angular, GraphQL and Material UI. I'm looking forward to starting my career as a web developer.",
