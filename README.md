### Challenges Encoutnered

1. After I tried to import react-bootstrap component, I encountered uncaught type error due to the react version for the template is too old. Problem solved after reading a stackoverflow post and update the React version for this project.
   "react": "^16.6.0",
   "react-dom": "^16.6.0",
