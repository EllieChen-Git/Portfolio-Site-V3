### Verions of my portfolio site

- [Ver 1](https://github.com/EllieChen-Git/Portfolio-Site_Ellie-Chen): A portfolio site built on pure HTML5, CSS3, SCCC and a little bit JavaScript. This is one of the student projects I built while I was studying with Coder Academy. I only learned coding for a month at the time I built it.

- [Ver 2](https://github.com/EllieChen-Git/React-Practice-Portfolio-Site) with React, Material UI, Bootstrap: A React practice by following YouTube tutorail.

### Challenges Encoutnered

1. After I tried to import react-bootstrap component, I encountered uncaught type error due to the react version for the template is too old. Problem solved after reading a stackoverflow post and update the React version for this project.
   "react": "^16.6.0",
   "react-dom": "^16.6.0",

2. I tried to create an environment variable to store a piece of information, but failed to do so.

1. With React, the environment variable needs to start with 'REACT*APP*'
1. I need to re-start my server evert time I change my .env file
   which I did learn about this while I was with Coder Academy, but I guess I'll never forget about this after this time
