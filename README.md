Previous verions of my portfolio site

- [Ver 1](https://github.com/EllieChen-Git/Portfolio-Site_Ellie-Chen): A portfolio site built on pure HTML5, CSS3, SCCC and a little bit JavaScript. This is one of the student projects I built while I was studying with Coder Academy. I only learned coding for a month at the time I built it.

- [Ver 2](https://github.com/EllieChen-Git/React-Practice-Portfolio-Site) with React, Material UI, Bootstrap: A React practice by following YouTube tutorail.
- [Ver 3](): The current portfolio website.
